# Brainf-ck
A small, properly written interpreter built in JavaScript ðŸ¤¯

## Introduction
Brainf-ck is an esoteric programming language originally created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. It's an extremely minimal language, with the original compiler only consisting of eight simple commands, a data pointer and an instruction pointer. Don't be fooled though, the name is adequately chosen as this language is one massive head fðŸ¤¯ck to create something in.

Nevertheless, Brainf-ck is considered Turing Complete, so, technically â€“ you could build anything with it.

However, one advantage of it's minimalism is that Brainf-ck is a great place to start when learning how programming languages work under the hood â€“ hence this little project.

Despite being small, this Brainf-ck interpreter has been written properly, lexing a source input, then parsing it to create an abstract syntax tree before the interpreter runs the code.

You can run the interpreter in the command line via Node and a shell script or, you can import it as a library and use the API to build a Brainf-ck interpreter into your website.

## Installation
Installing the package is fairly simple. You can either clone this repo directly or use NPM as detailed below.

### NPM
You can install the package via NPM
```
npm install brainf-ck
```

## Setup
Getting setup depends entirely on your environment.

### Node
To a program using Node, there's a handy shell script included in the package that takes a number of arguments in the command line. To simply interpret a Brainf-ck file, run the following command:
```
./brainf-ck --run PROGRAM.bf
```

The shell script takes arguments in the command line.

| Argument One   | Explanation                                        |
| ---------------| ---------------------------------------------------|
| ```--help```   | Use this to get help on the CLI. *Coming soon*     |
| ```--run```    | Use this to interpret a Brainf-ck file.            |
| ```--compile```| Use this to compile a Brainf-ck file. *Coming soon*|

### Browser
If you want to include the Brainf-ck interpreter client-side in your web applications you can do so by interacting with the Brainf-ck API.

**Example**
```
const Brainfuck = require('brainf-ck/browser');

new Brainfuck({
    viaNode: false,
    source: '[.+]',
    output: 'foo',
});
```

Again, the interpreter class takes an object as a parameter to define how the library functions. A list of configuration options are below:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Explanation                                                      |
|-----------|------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ```viaNode```   | Bool | Yes | Used to tell the interpreter whether or not to run via Node. |
| ```source```    | String | Yes* | A Brainf-ck program to interpret. |
| ```output```    | String | No | If you want to output the program straight to a HTML DOM element, you can pass it's ID here. |

*```source``` only required if you're running in browser as the interpreter has no native, easy way to read files. You can build this functionality in yourself should want it and pass the string output.

## The Language
As previously mentioned, Brainf-ck is an incredibly lightweight language. The original implementation and compiler for the The language consisted of just eight command, all other characters are ignored as comments. The commands are generally run in sequence with the program terminating when the instruction pointer moves past the last command.

The Brainf-ck language uses a simple machine model consisting of the instruction pointer, as well as a an array of at least 30,000 byte cells defaulting to zero and a movable data pointer to indicate which memory address to access.

**The commands are as follows:**

| Instruction | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| ```>```     | Move the data pointer to the right. |
| ```<```     | Move the data pointer to the left. |
| ```+```     | Increment the byte at the data pointer by one. |
| ```-```     | Decrement the byte at the data pointer by one. |
| ```.```     | Output the byte at the data pointer. |
| ```,```     | Take an input byte and store its value in the byte at the data pointer. |
| ```[```     | Essentially a ```while``` loop. If the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching ```]``` command. |
| ```]```     | If the byte at the data pointer is not zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching ```[``` command. |

### Language Extensions
I've also taken the liberty to extend the language slightly and add an ```if``` conditional. You don't have to use this but it may help when writing more complex programs in Brainf-ck.

**The commands for this are as follows:**
| Instruction | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| ```{```     | If the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching ```}``` command. If the data *is not* zero however, then execute the code contained in the ```{```, ```}``` just once before jumping the instruction pointer forward to the next command after the closing ```}``` command. |
| ```}```     | This command marks the end of the contained ```if``` conditional code.


*Please note: I'm still firming up these docs and the package itself.*
